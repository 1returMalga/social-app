## Step 2: Extract the CS 1.6 Dance Plugin
 
The second step is to extract the CS 1.6 Dance Plugin to your Counter-Strike 1.6 directory. To do this, you will need a program that can unzip files, such as WinRAR or 7-Zip. You can download WinRAR from here[^3^] or 7-Zip from here[^4^].
 
Once you have installed one of these programs, you can right-click on the CS 1.6 Dance Plugin zip file and choose "Extract Here" or "Extract to cstrike". This will create two folders: cstrike and sound.
 
Next, you will need to copy these folders to your Counter-Strike 1.6 directory. The default location of this directory is C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Half-Life\cstrike. If you have installed Counter-Strike 1.6 in a different location, you will need to find it and copy the folders there.

The third step is to enable the CS 1.6 Dance Plugin in your game. To do this, you will need to launch Counter-Strike 1.6 and open the console by pressing the tilde key (~) on your keyboard.
 
In the console, type "amx\_plugins" (without quotation marks) and press enter. This will show you a list of plugins that are installed on your game. You should see "DJ Mod [FINAL] ver 1" among them.
 
If you see this plugin, it means that the CS 1.6 Dance Plugin is installed and enabled successfully. You can close the console and start playing.
 
## Step 4: Use the CS 1.6 Dance Plugin
 
The final step is to use the CS 1.6 Dance Plugin in your game. To do this, you will need to open the dance menu by typing "say /dance" (without quotation marks) in the chat box or pressing F5 on your keyboard.
 
This will open a menu that shows you various dances and emotes that you can perform in the game. You can use the numbers on your keyboard or mouse wheel to select a dance and press enter or click to perform it.
 
You can also customize your own dance menu by editing the file "cstrike\addons\amxmodx\configs\djmod.ini". This file contains a list of dances and emotes that are available in the plugin, along with their names and commands.
 
You can add, remove, or change any dance or emote that you want by editing this file with a text editor such as Notepad or Notepad++. You can also change the name of the menu by editing the line "menu\_name = DJ Mod [FINAL] ver 1" at the top
